#PinePhone64 Install Scripts
Project was started to make it quick and easy to install images on the PinePhone64

#Roadmap
 - Add more images
 - Add more tools for formating (bmap-tool, dd)
 - Add a list of drives to verify for user and stress asking if it is the correct drive

#Extra
If the project expands I would like to add the ability to quickly get a development environment up and running.  I haven't gotten this far yet in my research, but maybe we can quickly deploy a chroot/docker/kvm or something and install the correct versions of SDKs and software.  Will do more research.  May not need this if an easier method already exists.

#Help
Pull requests welcome if you are so inclined.  

Thanks, Ryein
